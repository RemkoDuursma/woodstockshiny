The importance of healthy trees in urban landscapes is widely recognised as an important factor in the wellbeing of our populations and improving the liveability of our towns and cities. The nursery industry is championing significant increases in urban greenspace within the next five under the 202020 Vision project, calling for 20% more greenspace in urban centres by the year 2020.
The industry is committed to providing high-quality landscape trees and the recent adoption of the standard AS2303:2015 Tree Stock For Landscape Use is aimed at ensuring that trees conform to known standards that recognise the specific physiology, structural attributes and performance under different climatic regimes in order to assure a long and productive life in landscape plantings.
Presently, the standard enables assessment of performance metrics of landscape trees but there is a considerable gap in available knowledge on the performance of trees that includes climatic, species and container size. This research will provide the missing information through multivariate testing of these factors to consider their effects in an integrated way.
